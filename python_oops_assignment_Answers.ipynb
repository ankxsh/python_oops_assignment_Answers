            "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
            "Answer: Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code \n",
            "around objects and classes. It focuses on creating reusable code by modeling real-world entities \n",
            "as objects with attributes (data) and methods (behavior). OOP is based on four main principles: \n",
            "Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
            "Answer: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the \n",
            "attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have. Classes \n",
            "encapsulate data and behavior together in a single unit.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
            "Answer: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created from \n",
            "a class blueprint that has its own state (attribute values) and can perform actions through \n",
            "methods. Multiple objects can be created from the same class.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
            "Answer: Abstraction focuses on hiding complexity and showing only essential features \n",
            "to the user. It deals with what an object does. Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods \n",
            "together and restricting direct access to some components. It deals with how the object protects \n",
            "its internal state.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
            "Answer: Dunder methods (Double UNDERscore methods) are special methods in Python that \n",
            "have double underscores before and after their names (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). They \n",
            "are also called magic methods and allow us to define how objects of a class behave with built-in \n",
            "operations like initialization, string representation, arithmetic operations, etc.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
            "Answer: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child/derived class) inherits \n",
            "attributes and methods from an existing class (parent/base class). It promotes code reusability \n",
            "and establishes a relationship between classes. The child class can override parent methods and \n",
            "add its own attributes and methods.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
            "Answer: Polymorphism means 'many forms'. It allows objects of different classes to be \n",
            "treated as objects of a common parent class. The same method name can behave differently based on \n",
            "the object calling it. It can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
            "Answer: Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using private and protected attributes. \n",
            "Private attributes are prefixed with double underscore (__) and cannot be accessed directly from \n",
            "outside the class. Protected attributes are prefixed with single underscore (_). Python also uses \n",
            "property decorators to control access to attributes.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
            "Answer: A constructor is a special method __init__() that is automatically called when \n",
            "an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes and sets up the initial state. \n",
            "Python also has __new__() which is called before __init__() to create the object.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
            "Answer: Class methods are defined using @classmethod decorator and receive the class \n",
            "as the first parameter (cls). They can access and modify class state. Static methods are defined \n",
            "using @staticmethod decorator and don't receive the class or instance as first parameter. They \n",
            "behave like regular functions but belong to the class namespace.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
            "Answer: Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different \n",
            "parameters. Python doesn't support traditional method overloading like Java. Instead, we can \n",
            "achieve similar functionality using default arguments, variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs), \n",
            "or by checking argument types within the method.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
            "Answer: Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation \n",
            "of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The child class method has the same name, \n",
            "parameters, and return type as the parent class method but different implementation.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
            "Answer: The @property decorator allows us to define methods that can be accessed like \n",
            "attributes. It provides a way to implement getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes, \n",
            "allowing controlled access and validation while maintaining a simple attribute-like syntax.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
            "Answer: Polymorphism is important because it promotes code flexibility and reusability. \n",
            "It allows writing generic code that can work with objects of different classes, making the code \n",
            "more maintainable and extensible. It enables us to write one interface and have multiple \n",
            "implementations.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
            "Answer: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be \n",
            "subclassed. It contains one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must \n",
            "be implemented by child classes. In Python, abstract classes are created using the ABC module \n",
            "and @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
            "Answer: Main advantages include: 1) Code reusability through inheritance, 2) Data \n",
            "security through encapsulation, 3) Flexibility through polymorphism, 4) Easy maintenance and \n",
            "modification, 5) Better code organization and modularity, 6) Real-world modeling capability, \n",
            "7) Reduced complexity through abstraction.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
            "Answer: Class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are defined \n",
            "outside any method. Instance variables are unique to each instance and are defined inside __init__ \n",
            "method using self. Class variables are accessed using the class name or instance, while instance \n",
            "variables are accessed using self within methods.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
            "Answer: Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class. \n",
            "Python supports multiple inheritance, and the child class inherits attributes and methods from \n",
            "all parent classes. Method Resolution Order (MRO) determines which parent's method is called \n",
            "when there are conflicts.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q19. Explain the purpose of '__str__' and '__repr__' methods in Python\n",
            "Answer: __str__ returns a human-readable string representation of the object, used by \n",
            "print() and str(). __repr__ returns an unambiguous string representation that ideally could be \n",
            "used to recreate the object, used by repr() and in interactive mode. __str__ is for end users, \n",
            "__repr__ is for developers.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
            "Answer: super() is used to call methods from a parent class in the child class. It \n",
            "provides a way to access inherited methods that have been overridden. It's especially useful in \n",
            "multiple inheritance to follow the Method Resolution Order (MRO) correctly.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
            "Answer: __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed \n",
            "or garbage collected. It's used to perform cleanup operations like closing files or network \n",
            "connections. However, it's not guaranteed when it will be called, so it's not always reliable.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
            "Answer: @staticmethod doesn't receive any implicit first argument (no self or cls). \n",
            "It can't access or modify class or instance state. @classmethod receives the class as the first \n",
            "argument (cls) and can access or modify class state. Class methods are often used as factory \n",
            "methods.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
            "Answer: Polymorphism with inheritance allows child classes to override parent class \n",
            "methods with their own implementations. When a method is called on an object, Python uses the \n",
            "object's actual class (not the reference type) to determine which method to execute, enabling \n",
            "different behaviors for the same method call.\n",

            "\n",
            "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
            "Answer: Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same \n",
            "object in a single statement. Each method returns 'self' (the object itself), allowing the next \n",
            "method to be called on the returned object. This creates a fluent interface.\n",
            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "\n",
            "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
            "Answer: The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called as a function. \n",
            "When you use parentheses on an object (obj()), Python calls the __call__ method. This is useful \n",
            "for creating callable objects, decorators, or implementing function-like behavior in classes.\n",
